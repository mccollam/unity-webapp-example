====================

Example code for integrating a web application with Ubuntu Unity.

A more detailed walkthrough is available in my blog article ["Integrating your web application with Ubuntu Unity"](http://blog.ronaldmccollam.com/2013/01/integrating-your-web-application-with.html).

The [API documentation](https://developer.ubuntu.com/api/devel/ubuntu-13.10/javascript/web-docs/unity-web-api-reference.html) is probably also of interest.
